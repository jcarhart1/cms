Please run the .exe file in the exe directory first. This will insure that the \data dir is populated with data from all 20 samples.

You will have to open each of the files in the \lib dir and adjust the directory pointer to your local drive.

Note to self: Need to work on this so that user does not have to open each file in \lib dir and do the boring manual stuff. Use env var instead, dumdum
